## Introduction

The sentiment Analysys can get honest insights for your product from User review or random Tweet.

Doc2Vec is a technology to vectorize documents of arbitrary length. We can get distributed representations of documents and texts. By measuring the degree of similarity between vectors, document classification and similar documents can be searched.

The input in CBoW of Word2Vec was only word ID which expressed the word one-hot, Doc2Vec uses information obtained by adding a paragraph ID to a word ID.
